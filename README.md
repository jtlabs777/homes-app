# Angular Tutorial Recap

This README provides a summary of the essential concepts I learned during an Angular tutorial, including components, directives, routing, and services. Additionally, it includes the necessary commands for setting up and running the Angular application.

## Learning Objectives

During the tutorial, I learned several crucial aspects of Angular:

- **Components:** I learned how to create and customize Angular components, which are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.

- **Directives:** I explored how to manipulate the DOM by using Angular's built-in directives and even creating custom ones.

- **Routing:** I delved into Angular's powerful routing system to create a seamless navigation experience within the application.

- **Services and Dependency Injection:** I learned how to build services and use Angular's dependency injection mechanism to manage the application's data flow and logic.

## Requirements

To run this application, you'll need to have the latest stable Long Term Support (LTS) versions of Node.js and Angular installed on your system. At the time of writing, this refers to Node.js v18.16.0 LTS and Angular v12.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Install Node.js:** Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Angular CLI:** Use npm (which is bundled with Node.js) to install Angular CLI globally on your system by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

3. **Install project dependencies:** Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to install all necessary project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

After setting up, you can start the application by running:
```bash
ng serve

By default, the application will be running on port 4200. To view the application, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200.


## Conclusion

This tutorial was an enriching experience in understanding core concepts of Angular. I hope that the knowledge I've gained will be beneficial for future Angular projects, and that this README will be a helpful guide for those who wish to run the application.
